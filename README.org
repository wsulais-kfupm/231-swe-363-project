* Contribution

All commits should follow conventional commit structure with the scope indicating which part of the project being worked on.

Here are some examples of commit messages. Note the extra scope added when it makes sense.
#+begin_example
feat(front): Implement products page
fix(back): Allow unauthenticated API access
chore(report/proposal): Elaborate on idea
#+end_example

Try to keep commit messages less than 50 characters, and in general, follow [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-best-practices-commits-and-code-reviews/][the 12 git commandments]].
** Branches
Try to work within a feature branch when implementing features.
A good rule of thumb is, if it's more than 2 /atomic/ commits then you should use a branch for it.

Don't forget to make a [[https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/what-are-git-pull-requests-and-how-do-you-use-them/][pull request]] when you're finished to put everything on ~main~.
